This is a PHP 5.6 fork of the wonderful spatie/ssl-certificate library for validating, analyzing, and getting SSL certificate meta data.

I needed a 5.6 port for a project I was working on. If you don't need a 5.6 compatible version, then please use the standard library 

instead. https://github.com/spatie/ssl-certificate
